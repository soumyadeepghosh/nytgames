This is a personal project that seeks to implement computational solutions to the various games published by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords).

## Sudoku

To run the Sudoku program, go to the `Sudoku` source directory and run `make`. It will produce an
executable with the name `sudoku` in the directory. To run the program, use the command:
```
./sudoku <path to input file>
```

The input file contains the unfilled with Sudoku grid, with each single dot implying an unfilled
cell. Sample inputs are provided in the `Sudoku/inputs` directory.
